# About the Project
#### The project uses tensorflow to create a simple model that classifies flower as per four types. The dataset for the flower can be accessed through the Keras datasets. 
#### To download the required datasets, run the code. This will also save a model that can be used later.
#### The repo also contains a project that uses the MobileNetv2 model for flower classification.
